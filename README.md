Monty Interpreter


Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Monty Byte Code Files

Monty byte code files usually have the .m extension. Each file contains Monty byte codes, with one instruction per line. Instructions can have any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument. Blank lines and additional text after the opcode or its required argument are ignored.
